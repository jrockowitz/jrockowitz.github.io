    <p>I grew up in a big blue house. The big blue house is a central theme to my artwork. Sitting in front of a computer in the basement of this big blue house is where I learned how to build websites so it seem fitting to call my company, which I incorporated in 2000, 'The Big Blue House Production'.</p>
